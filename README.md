# Module4 Zillow Best Zipcode
### Libraries used:
#### Pandas
#### Matplotlib
#### pyramid.arima
#### multiprocessing
#### fbprophet
#### sklearn
#### math
###### I used some Zillow API data to figure out which zipcodes in the whole country are the best to invest in. I processed the data using the very fast Pandas python library with all of its built-ins. I used FBprophet modeling to make a model that predicted 1 year, 2 years, and 4 years into the future and I used that data along with matplotlib to make a visual of the returns and the risks associated with the investments. 

## Be careful there is an error in the data, there is a few missing values in a few zipcodes. If you read the comments you can see where you will have to run items in the jupyter notebook out of order. It shouldn't be that much of a problem.





# Thanks!
